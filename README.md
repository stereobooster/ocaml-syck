# ocaml-syck

Mirror of OCaml YAML parser

**syck** is not supported.

Alternatives:
 - [LibYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML), [psych](https://github.com/ruby/psych) is based on it
 - Pure OCaml implementations: [oyaml](https://github.com/mk270/oyaml), [camlyaml](https://github.com/Kakadu/camlyaml). Take one of those as examples for implementation https://github.com/opsb/rbyaml, https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml

TODO:
 - http://ocaml_beginners.yahoogroups.narkive.com/2ak7Fj4Q/ocaml-syck-compilation-problem
 - embed syck lib
 - convert to opam
